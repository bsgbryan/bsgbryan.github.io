# In the beginning

- - -

I was born as a young age. Fresh-faced, hopeful, and screaming I came into the
world with one mission: _eat_. Quickly, my next mission became clear.

I was born during the [Blizzard of '78](http://www.blizzardof78.org/) in
[Superior Township, MI](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Superior+Charter+Twp,+MI/@42.3042811,-83.6729353,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x883caa107d008219:0x64b83e033a683017!8m2!3d42.3010178!4d-83.6051935) precisely on my due
date.

I lived in the small town of [Chelsea, MI](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chelsea,+MI+48118/@42.3140786,-84.0557904,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x883ccd94fe56d5e9:0x4cdc35f9fb05974f!8m2!3d42.3180919!4d-84.0205029) until I was approximately
six. I vividely remember my first crush, making a harmonica from tissue paper
and a comb (something my older friends saw on [Mr Wizard](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085060/)),
eating nothing but potatoes for long stretches of time (we were rather poor),
getting my Storm Trooper stuck in the basement wall, and having mixed feelings
about moving.
