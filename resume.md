Intro
=====

A lover of technology from childhood, I am a self taught developer always seeking to sharpen my skills, broaden my horizons, and add to my toolbox.

I love solving challenging problems. I love working with great teams. I love making things that improve people’s lives. I love mentoring and teaching people. I love learning. I love that I get to do this for a living.

Over the next few pages you’ll see what my love and hard work looks like - I hope you enjoy the read.

Thank you

Personal Projects
=================

**Jumpy McRunface** `mobile_platformer(Infinity)`
--------------------------------------------------

Jumpy McRunface is a fun, zen little infinite platformer. Built largely as an experiment to learn about procedural content generation and to fulfill a life-long dream to be a game developer.

**Babbling On** `game_repo && tutorial_set`
----------------------------------------------

Babbling On is my attempt at jump starting a new format for tutorials and learning. I’m not sure how it will go, but so far I’m enjoying the project and finding ways to improve my other repos.

I started looking into Babylon.js recently as a tool to help prototyping game ideas and mechanics. I realized quickly that I should add inline diff comments so I could come back for reference when I needed to down the road. This got me thinking that maybe, with the proper organization and structure, a repo itself could be a good source of learning.

For more information, please visit [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MayBGames/babbling-on).
